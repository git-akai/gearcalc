# Working on this repository

A **map**, not a summary. The four documents in `docs/` say what the tool
computes, why, what was once wrong and what is built; this says where things are
and what it costs to change them.

It exists because the project is about 14,000 lines of code carrying 10,700
lines of comment, alongside 5,100 lines of standalone document — **prose
outweighs code a little over 1 to 1**. That ratio is the reason the model
decisions here are auditable and it is not a target to reduce. What it does mean
is that finding the right file matters more here than in most codebases, and
until this file existed there was no way to do it but read the crate.

*(The first version of this paragraph said 1.5 to 1, having counted
`docs/history/`, which is the **superseded** design record that nothing points
at. A ratio quoted from a `wc` over a glob is a figure like any other.)*

> An audit is in progress. [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) carries its state, its
> findings and what has been decided. Read it before starting work, and delete
> it when the audit is done.

## The rules that are not negotiable

Each was arrived at by something going wrong, and each is enforced by something
other than good intentions. `docs/rationale.md#the-standing-rules` argues them;
this is the short form.

1. **No engineering calculation in TypeScript.** If a number appears in the UI,
   Rust computed it. A *default* is one of those numbers, and so is a bound and
   so is an angle in degrees. Typing an engineering number into a `.ts` file is
   the bug.
2. **No English in `gear-core`.** The core emits a `Note` — a stable key and the
   values a sentence needs, with the numbers already formatted. Every word lives
   in `crates/gear-io/data/strings_<code>.toml`.
3. **Inputs are the only state.** Outputs are recomputed, never stored. A full
   train solve is microseconds.
4. **Find the parameter, not the branch.** A ring is a gear with a negative tooth
   count; a spur gear is helical at β = 0; a rack is a shaper at `z → ∞`. Every
   surviving `match kind` is a place two answers can silently disagree.
5. **Clamp rather than refuse, and say so** — where the input describes something
   that can nearly be cut. Refuse input that describes *no shape at all*.
6. **A conservative answer is not a free one.** "Conservative" states an error's
   direction and never justifies it. Every known bias is written down with its
   **size and sign** in `docs/state.md`.

## Which file answers which question

The load-bearing column is the last one. Knowing that `hertz.rs` has never heard
of a gear is worth more than knowing what it does.

### `crates/gear-core` — all the mathematics, no I/O, no UI, no wasm

| File | Answers | Does not know |
|---|---|---|
| `solve.rs` | Two bracketed root finders. Every transcendental step routes through them | anything about gears |
| `involute.rs` | `inv α = tan α − α`, and its safeguarded inverse | " |
| `elliptic.rs` | Carlson symmetric elliptic integrals | " |
| `hertz.rs` | General Hertzian contact; line contact is the degenerate value | " — a concave body is a negative radius, which is why there is no internal case |
| `plane.rs` | The normal and transverse planes, the identities between them, the basic rack | tooth counts |
| `params.rs` | A gear's inputs, and the record of any guard that altered them | how any of them is used |
| `note.rs` | What the solve wants a person to read, as a key plus values | any word of English |
| `tooth.rs` | **One tooth's form** at one shift, cut by one `Rack` | that a gear has more than one tooth |
| `gear.rs` | **The assembly**: teeth seated round an axis, cut by one tool. An ordinary gear is `Δx = 0` | anything about a mate, except through `mesh` |
| `shaper.rs` | Generation by a pinion cutter, of which the rack is the `z → ∞` limit | which of the two it is being used for |
| `ring.rs` | Internal gear geometry: the flank, where the tool sits, the limits | external gears |
| `outline.rs` | The gear outline as a CAD-ready closed path, to a chord tolerance | file formats |
| `mesh.rs` | Two gears in mesh: centre distance, operating angle, backlash | load, material, or strength |
| `contact.rs` | The path of contact and how load is shared along it | stress |
| `screw.rs` | Crossed-axis screw gearing — one model for a worm and a crossed pair | that a worm is special |
| `hula.rs` | The hula **arrangement**: four counts, one crank offset, the shifts that close it | loads and ratings |
| `planetary.rs` | Planetary **layout** and Willis/Pennestrì kinematics | tooth form |
| `strength.rs` | The critical section, both notch models, `Y_F`, `K_f`, Hertz beside it. `ToothOutline` is the seam that makes one model serve a tooth and a ring | which stage kind is asking |
| `metrology.rs` | Span over teeth, over-pins, and what they take round a revolution | tolerances (that is `jgma.rs`) |
| `jgma.rs` | JGMA 116-02 tolerance tables, transcribed and checked | how a tolerance is used |
| `material.rs` | Elastic constants and stress allowables | where the numbers came from (that is the `basis` field) |
| `auto.rs` | Automatic values: the undercut shift, the tip-width addendum, admissible ranges, and `maximise` | what a stage is |
| `verify.rs` | The cut simulated from the cutter alone — the instrument, not the model | the model it checks |
| `testing.rs` | Numerical helpers the tests check closed forms against | *(test-only)* |

### `crates/gear-core/src/train` — the stage kinds

| File | Answers |
|---|---|
| `mod.rs` | **What every kind shares**: load cases, `MemberRating`, `Bending`, `MeshReport`, `GearResult`, the engagement rule, and the train that strings stages together |
| `spur.rs` | The parallel-axis stage — spur at β = 0, helical otherwise. Also **declares `StageGear`**, which every kind uses |
| `planetary.rs` | One carrier, one sun, one ring, N planets |
| `worm.rs` | The worm stage and the crossed-helical pair — one model, differing in one input |
| `hula.rs` | The hula stage: the arrangement built, cut and rated |

### The other crates

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `crates/gear-io` | DXF export · the TOML material library and geartrain documents · the string catalogues |
| `crates/gear-wasm` | The boundary. 17 entry points, JSON in and JSON out, all pure |
| `crates/gear-cli` | The development harness. `gear-cli help` prints its subcommands, from the `COMMANDS` table that *is* its dispatch |
| `web/src` | Svelte 5 + TypeScript. Layout and event handling **only** |
| `web/src/wire` | **Generated** by `ts-rs`. Never edited by hand |
| `tools/` | The checks that live outside the Rust suite |
| `handoff_inbound/` | Prior Python work. **Reference only** — do not build on it |

## To change X, touch these

Traced, not guessed. The fan-out is real and most of it is load-bearing — five
string catalogues is what five languages costs.

| Change | Files | Then run |
|---|---|---|
| **A model or formula** | the one module in `gear-core` | `cargo nextest run` · `tools/check_golden.sh` · `tools/check_figures.py` |
| **A stage-level input** | the stage kind's file · `train/mod.rs` if shared · `auto.rs` if a search reads it · 5 × `strings_*.toml` · `web/src/TrainPanel.svelte` | the above, plus `tools/check_bindings.sh --write` and `tools/check_strings.py` |
| **A per-gear input** | `params.rs` · the generator that reads it · `auto.rs` (`admissible_ranges`) · 5 × `strings_*.toml` · `web/src/GearPanel.svelte` | as above |
| **A note the solve emits** | `note.rs` (the key) · the site that raises it · 5 × `strings_*.toml` | `cargo nextest run` — `gear_io::strings` checks both directions by *firing every note* |
| **A UI string with no `Note` behind it** | 5 × `strings_*.toml` · the `.svelte` that reads it | `tools/check_strings.py` |
| **A material** | `crates/gear-io/data/materials_default.toml` | `cargo nextest run` — every non-datasheet value must carry a note saying what it is |
| **A CLI subcommand** | one row in `gear-cli/src/main.rs`'s `COMMANDS`, carrying how its output is recorded | `tools/check_golden.sh --write` — the script asks the binary, so there is no second list |
| **A type that crosses the boundary** | the Rust type | `tools/check_bindings.sh --write`, then `cd web && npm run check` |
| **A documented figure** | the document | `tools/check_figures.py` — and tag the block with what generates it |
| **A language** | one new `strings_<code>.toml` · the list in `gear-io/src/strings.rs` | `cargo nextest run` — a translation that falls behind English's key set fails |

---

## Which check catches what

Eleven checks in six different ways. `nix flake check` is **not** all of them.

| Run | Catches | In CI |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo nextest run` | The suite: laws, independent verifications, invariants, canaries, negative fixtures. **No count is quoted here** — a number that dates belongs in `docs/state.md`, and this file had one stale within an hour of being written | via `nix flake check` |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets -- --deny warnings` | `unwrap` in production is a warning, and warnings are denied | " |
| `cargo fmt --check` | | " |
| `nix build .#web` | **the site — `flake check` does not cover it**, and it carries a fixed-output hash over `web/package-lock.json` that nothing else consults | yes |
| `cd web && npm run check` | types, which the bundler strips without checking | yes |
| `tools/check_bindings.sh` | `web/src/wire` still matches the Rust it is generated from | yes |
| `tools/check_doc_links.py` | every pointer into the documents resolves, both from code and between documents | yes |
| `tools/check_strings.py` | every `ui.` message is used and every use has a message | yes |
| `tools/check_golden.sh` | **any number the harness prints that moved.** A change detector, not a correctness gate: a diff is a question | yes |
| `tools/check_figures.py` | every figure the documents print is one the code still prints | yes |
| `python3 tools/validate_dxf.py` | an export read back by a parser that shares no code with the writer | yes |
| `tools/worm_flank_curvature.py` · `crossed_path.py` · `hula_kinematics.py` · `iso_6336_3_stack.py` | the crate against derivations that share no code with it | no — by hand |

**Before pushing, run five:** `cargo nextest run`, `nix flake check`,
`nix build .#web`, `cd web && npm run check`, and **`tools/check_golden.sh`**.
Reading `flake check` as the whole of CI has cost one red build.

The corpus is on that list because of a measurement, not for symmetry.
Perturbing five of the rating model's cited constants — `K_f`'s `H` and `L`,
ISO's `Y_S`, the tangent angle, the reversed-bending fraction — leaves the
**entire test suite silent**, and the corpus catches every one. A `nextest` run
is not evidence that the strength model is the one that was there yesterday.

## How to test here

In rough order of what has actually caught things.

1. **Verify against something that shares no code.** The rack simulation, the
   pin-tangency measurement, `ezdxf`, the contact-half-width route, the crossed
   path differentiated off the flanks. Every one caught something self-consistent
   tests had passed.
   — *and ask what the independent tool does with a defect.* `ezdxf` builds a
   document, supplying whatever the file omitted, and then agreed it was sound.
   SOLIDWORKS refused it.
2. **Ask what property the answer must have**, checkable without knowing the
   answer.
3. **Prefer a law to a threshold.** A bound taken from a measurement records
   where the sweep stopped, not a fact about the thing.
4. **Turn every axis, in every context it reaches.** `tests/common/mod.rs` is one
   grid with every input nameable. A control turned on a lone gear and left at
   its default wherever it meets a mate is untested.
5. **Before trusting a new gate, run it against the broken code.**
   `git worktree add` a detached HEAD, copy the test in, watch it fail. A gate
   that cannot fail is not a gate — this project has three recorded that could
   not.

---

## Things that look wrong and are not

Four in `tooth.rs`, and the tests that hold each:

1. **The flank continues below the base circle** to its true intersection with
   the trochoid. Clamping and bridging leaves a 0.3 mm step on undercut gears.
2. **The fillet fit cap is `w_tip·cos α / (2(1 − sin α))`.** The plausible
   `w_tip / (2 cos α)` silently shrinks the fillet on every shifted gear.
3. **`θ` is not monotone** along the profile. Undercut gears are legitimately
   re-entrant; the invariant is monotone **radius**.
4. **A rack's figures do not carry to a pinion cutter.** `ShaperCut` refuses a
   tool it cannot hold rather than clamping it.

And elsewhere:

- **`CriticalSection::TangentAngle` and `RootStressModel::Iso6336` look like dead
  code.** No stage reaches them. They are the *instrument* — `gear-cli matrix`
  runs both coherent sets, and it is the only way this tool can be checked
  against a published standard. They go when that command does.
- **`verify.rs` is in the library rather than in `tests/`** so the CLI can sweep
  it over thousands of cases.
- **Two notes nothing can fire** are named in `strings.rs`'s `UNFIRED` with their
  evidence. Live code, live messages, deliberately not deleted on suspicion.
